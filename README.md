For correct work–±  employee.json file should be in public/app folder

In the project I used lodash, although it is redundant for this project, I want to show that I can use, and it's 
have  more elegant way of getting data in my opinion.

I didn't use axios post query cuz it's require local server, instead of it I used redux for adding new employee.

Jest : Yes, I understand that the snapshots is redundant, but I still added it.

Thank you!
